   <td><p><strong>Amped-up Blush</strong></p><p>Why should your summer glow end after summer? Start piling on the blush to achieve 
   that effortless sun-kissed glow. This is also a great way to make your skin look more awake when wearing minimal makeup. Make sure 
   to drag your blush up near your brow bone for a more sculpted look. Add it on your nose, too, for extra warmth. 
   Blushes come in all colors and textures. Find what works for you and own it!</p></td>

   <td><p><strong>Fox Eye Liner</strong></p><p>This one may take some practice! This eye look is a way to achieve a more lifted and defined 
   eye. Use a dark eyeshadow or liner to create a soft wing on the outer corner of your eye. Blend it out a bit near your crease. Then do 
   your inner corner liner. Make sure to use a liner or brush with a super precise tip. Below is a tutorial by Brianna Fox.</p>

   <td><p><strong>Bold Red Lip</strong></p><p>Red lips are super in this season, especially paired with a natural glow makeup look. 
   Go for a matte long-wear liquid lipstick to keep your look on all day, even under that mask! Add a gloss if you prefer a shinier look. 
   Have fun with it!</td>
