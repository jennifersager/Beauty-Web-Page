		<h2>The Importance of Skincare</h2>
		<p>If you have not began investing in your skin, it's time to start now. Listed below are some simple skincare tips that
		are helpful to know! 
		<ul>
		  <li>Vitamin C is your best friend! From uneven skin tone, fine lines, acne scars, and dullness, Vitamin C is recommended to help.
		  The best form of vitamin C to use for your skin is a serum because they are more effective than creamers or toners. Those with sensitive 
		  skin should be careful. It is possible to have allergies and redness. It is recommended to start with a lower concentration.</li>
		  <li>Interested in chemical peels? They are used to treat fine wrinkles, acne, and uneven skin tone. Use glycolic acid for normal skin, 
		  salicylic acid for oily or combination skin, and gentle lactic acid for dry or sensitive skin.</li>
		  <li>Never forget sunscreen! It is so important no matter your skin tone. Wearing sunscreen should be a year-round thing, whether the 
		  sun is out or not. On cloudy days most of the sun's rays can still pass through the clouds and snow can reflect up to 80 percent of 
		  UV rays. Protect your skin, lower your cancer risk, and prevent premature aging.</li>
		  <li>Never use expired products:
		   <ul>
		     <li>Mascara and eyeliner: 3 to 6 months</li>
		     <li>Foundation and concealer: 6 months to 1 year</li>
		     <li>Powder products: 2 to 3 years</li>
		     <li>Lipstick: 2 to 3 years</li>
		     <li>Cleansers: 1 year</li>
		     <li>Toners: 6 months to 1 year</li>
		     <li>Exfoliants: 1 year</li>
		     <li>Moisturizers and serums: 6 months to 1 year</li>
		     <li>Lip balm: 1 year</li>
		    </ul>
	      </li>
		  <li>Add an extra pillow when you sleep to prop yourself up to help prevent puffy eyes when waking up.</li>
		  <li>Breakouts along the hairline can be caused by oils from hair products. A foaming face wash can help cut through the oils.</li>
		  <li>It is possible to use too much of a skincare product. You only need a small amount. Sunscreen is the product you should be using the 
		  most of and you only need a cherry-sized amount.</li>
		  <li>Moisture is everything, even if you have oily skin. Your skin will actually product more oils if you do not moisturize enough. Make sure 
		  to apply moisturizer to a wet face to lock it in.</li>
		  <li>Get to know your skin type. Being misinformed and using the wrong products can compromise your skin and cause irritations, breakouts, 
		  and even premature aging. Use this <a href="https://www.totalbeauty.com/content/quizzes/q_skin_type">skin type quiz</a> to help you figure 
		  out what kind of skin you have and offer advice.</li>
		  </ul>
