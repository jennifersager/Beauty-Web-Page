		<h2>Your Guide to Beauty Trends!</h2>
		<p>Are you into beauty and want to keep up with the trends? Then you are in the right spot. Welcome to Beauty Geek! Here we keep you updated 
		on the newest trends in hair, makeup, and nails. We also have a page dedicated to skincare with a link to a skin type quiz! You don't have to be 
		a professional to love all things beauty, but it is still helpful to know the latest info. Beauty for us is about enhancing the features that you 
		already have, not covering them. It is about happy hair, happy skin, and of course happy minds.</p>
		<p>The beauty industry is always changing. Trends come and go, so be creative and add your own touch to everything you do. Trends can be used as 
		guides and inspiration. They are exciting and can help create new ideas and projects. There are endless possibilities when it comes to beauty. It is 
		an art form with its use of line work, color, and tools. For a long time, hair, makeup, and nails were just a simple part of everyday life. With the advances 
		of technology and social media, the beauty industry took a huge leap and is growing every single day.</p>
